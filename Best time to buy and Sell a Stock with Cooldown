# Aim:  
To determine the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling stocks multiple times while following the restriction that after selling a stock,
you must wait (cooldown) one day before buying again.

#code: 
int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
    int buy(INT_MIN), sell(0), prev_sell(0), prev_buy;
    for (int price : prices) {
        prev_buy = buy;
        buy = max(prev_sell - price, buy);
        prev_sell = sell;
        sell = max(prev_buy + price, sell);
    }
    return sell;
}
